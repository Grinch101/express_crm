# express_crm

As mentioned in other projects, I have already written identical CRMs with two libraries (Django and Flask) in Python. It would be a great practice to do it again, but this time using JavaScript and Node.js and Express.js.
In this project, I wrote the very same RESTful API using Node as a runtime environment and Express as a framework.

I used PostgreSQL as my database and you can setup the database with runnig migration/1.SQL
